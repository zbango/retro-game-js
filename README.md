# Retro Game Project

Welcome to my Retro Game project! This endeavor is a personal tribute to the classic video games that many of us grew up loving, now reimagined using pure JavaScript, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and the HTML canvas element.

## Live Version

Experience the game firsthand by visiting the live version here: [Play Retro Game](https://retro-game-js-zbangosystems.vercel.app/).

This web adaptation brings the beloved classic gameplay directly to your browser, allowing you to jump into the fun without any downloads or installations. Whether you're reminiscing about the past or discovering these gems for the first time, I hope you enjoy the mix of nostalgia and contemporary technology.

## Instructions

To ensure the best gaming experience, here are the controls for the game:

- **Spacebar:** Fire your weapon.
- **Left Arrow:** Move left.
- **Right Arrow:** Move right.
- **R:** Restart the game.

These controls are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the game without having to worry about complicated command schemes.
